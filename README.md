## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have [C++ Compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) installed and configured on your machine. Once *Compiler* is installed, download `main.cpp` from `src` directory. 


### Execution

Below are the instructions that will help you run `main.py`.

1. Run command prompt.
2. Write the following intructions on _cmd_,
```sh
$ # Assign execution permissions
$ chmod +x main.cpp
$ # Run the script by using its filename
$ ./main.py
```


## Roadmap

- [x] Addition
- [x] Subtraction
- [x] Base Conversion
- [ ] Multiplication
- [ ] Division
